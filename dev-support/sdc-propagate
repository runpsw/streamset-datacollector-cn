# Build and propagate change in sub-module of StreamSets Data collector
#
# 1) First run a full build of data collector (mvn install  -Pdist,ui -DskipTests)
# 2) `cd` to desired maven module (must be a first-level module), for example hive-protolib
#    and run this script.
# 3) The script will build and then propagate the updated jar to all places in the dist/target/
#    module so that you can run updated SDC from there.
